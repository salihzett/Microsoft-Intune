# Custom attributes

You can setup these custom attributes under https://endpoint.microsoft.com/
```
Home -> Devices -> macOS -> Custom attributes -> +
```

Choose a name for one custom attribute, choose "Data type of attribute" and upload the script.

Assign that script to the group you want, e.g. a dynamic group for all corporate macOS devices.

You will see the results/output of these scripts under

```
Home -> Devices -> macOS -> Custom attributes -> <script name> -> Device status and Result tab
```
